## My process

I started building the desktop design first as it was more complicated than the mobile.
I used CSS grids for the cards, and flexbox for the inside of each of the cards


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first



### What I learned
I learned how to use CSS Grids and flexbox hand in hand.




### Continued development

I'm not really good at using CSS Grids , but in further projects, I'll learn more about it.
